# XYZ Hotels API Core Project

This project is an API Core implementation for XYZ Hotels, a renowned hotel chain operating globally. It aims to streamline the reservation process and provide an efficient booking experience for customers. The project is developed using a code-first approach and includes features such as CRUD operations, filtering capabilities, room availability counts, JWT token authentication, exception handling, and the repository pattern.

## Features

- CRUD Operations: The API allows for creating, reading, updating, and deleting hotel information, empowering hotel staff to manage hotel details effectively.
- Filtering: Customers can search and filter hotels based on criteria such as location, price range, or amenities, enabling a personalized booking experience.
- Count Functionality: Users can obtain counts of available rooms in specific hotels, providing insights into room availability for informed decision-making.
- JWT Token Authentication: The API employs JWT token authentication to ensure secure access to protected resources, safeguarding customer and hotel data.
- One-to-Many Relationship: The project handles the one-to-many relationship between hotels and rooms, allowing each hotel to have multiple rooms for efficient management.
- Exception Handling: The API gracefully handles exceptions, providing meaningful error messages to ensure system stability and a smooth user experience.
- Repository Pattern: The repository pattern is utilized to separate the data access layer from the business logic, promoting code modularity and maintainability.
